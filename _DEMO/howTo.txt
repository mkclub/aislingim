1)	C++: Code generation: Runtime Library: Multi-threaded (/MT)

2)	Linker: Input: Additional Dependencies:
	wininet.lib;dnsapi.lib;version.lib;msimg32.lib;ws2_32.lib;usp10.lib;psapi.lib;dbghelp.lib;winmm.lib;shlwapi.lib;strmiids.lib;Strmiids.lib;dmoguids.lib;wmcodecdspuuid.lib;amstrmid.lib;msdmo.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)

3) Include necessary libjingle libs (e.g., including into the project OR adding to 
	Linker: Input: Additional Dependencies:
		..\..\..\libjingle_libs\$(Configuration)\libjingle.lib
		..\..\..\libjingle_libs\$(Configuration)\expat.lib)

you can put all (at least -- necessary) libs to the aislingim\libjingle_libs\[Debug | Release] 
(Debug for debug libs and Release for release libs, 
e.g. aislingim\libjingle_libs\Release\libjingle.lib for release version of libjingle lib.)

and all applications will try to resolve necessary dependencies from this folder.

4) Include necessary libjingle headers.
	Necessary header files can be collected with the help of HeaderCollector app (requires .NET).

5) If you use Release version of libjingle, you can build your app only in release mode. (sorry, life sux)
	And if you configured anything in Debug mode first, don't forget to repeat steps from the very first. ;-)
